# Titanic
Datacamp Exercise

Set Sail

When the Titanic sank, 1502 of the 2224 passengers and crew got killed. One of the main reasons for this high level of casualties was the lack of lifeboats on this supposedly unsinkable ship.

Those that have seen the movie know that some individuals were more likely to survive the sinking (lucky Rose) than others (poor Jack). In this course you wil apply machine learning techniques to predict a passenger's chance of surviving using R.
